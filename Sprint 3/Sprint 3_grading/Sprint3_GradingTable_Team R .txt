| Sprint Planning          | 9.0/9               | Suggestion : Try to keep the "Done" section clear whenever a new sprint begins. Its recommended not to have anything under Done section at the beginning of the Sprint, otherwise later on it is difficult to determine what tasks & how many tasks got completed during this Sprint. |
